Shapes.

Coordination freeness.
Invariance under deformation.
Compressed representation (ex. trangulation).

Let $X$ be a nonempty set, and let $\tau$ be a collection of subsets of $X$.
We say that $\tau$ defines a **topology** on $X$ if the empty set $\empty$ and $X$
itself lie in $\tau$, if the union of any family of elements of $\tau$ is again
an element of $\tau$, and if the intersection of any finite collection of elements
of $\tau$ is also an element of $\tau$.
The combination of $X$ and $\tau$ is called a **topological space**.

The finest topology on X is the discrete topology; this topology makes all
subsets open. The coarsest topology on X is the trivial topology; this topology
only admits the empty set and the whole space as open sets.

# Space

An **open set** is an abstract concept generalizing the
idea of an open interval in the real line.

Each choice of definition for *open set* is called **topology**.
A set with a topology is called a **topological space**.

let X be a set and let τ be a family of subsets of X. Then τ is called a
topology on X if:

-    Both the empty set and X are elements of τ.
-    Any union of elements of τ is an element of τ.
-    Any intersection of finitely many elements of τ is an element of τ.

If τ is a topology on X, then the pair (X, τ) is called a topological space. The notation Xτ may be used to denote a set X endowed with the particular topology τ.

The members of τ are called open sets in X. A subset of X is said to be closed
if its complement is in τ (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of X may be
open, closed, both (clopen set), or neither. The empty set and X itself are
always both closed and open. A subset of X including an open set containing a
point x is called a 'neighborhood' of x.

Two coninuous functions from one topological space
to another are called **homotopic** if one can be "continuously
deformed" into the other, such a deformation being called
a **homotopy** between the two functions.

A set might be open, closed, both, or neither.

$X$ topolical space  
$p\in X$  
A **neighbourhood** of $p$ is a subset $V$ of $X$
that includes an open set $V$ contining $p$.  
$p\in U \subseteq V$  
Two points are **topologically indinguistable** if they have
exactly the same neighbourhoods.

A **space** is a set (sometimes called a universe) with some added structure.
A **topological space** may be defined as a *set* of *points*, along with a set of
*neighbourhoods* for each point, satisfying a set of *axioms* relating points and
neighbourhoods.

-    *Continuous functions*, intuitively, take nearby points to nearby points.
-    *Compact sets* are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size.
-    *Connected sets* are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart.

The words 'nearby', 'arbitrarily small', and 'far apart' can all be made
precise by using open sets.
Each choice of definition for 'open set' is called a topology. A set with a
topology is called a topological space.

Let $X$ be a set and $\tau$ be a family of sets.
We say that $\tau$ is a **topology** on $X$ if:

- $X$ and $\empty$ are in $\tau$
- any union of sets in $\tau$ is in $\tau$
- any finite intersection of sets in $\tau$ is in $\tau$

We call the sets in τ $\tau$ the open sets.

Every subset A of a topological space X contains a (possibly empty) open set;
the largest such open set is called the interior of A. It can be constructed by
taking the union of all the open sets contained in A.

Given topological spaces X and Y, a function f from X to Y is continuous if the
preimage of every open set in Y is open in X. The function f is called open if
the image of every open set in X is open in Y.

If there are two topologies on the same set, a set U that is open in the first
topology might fail to be open in the second topology. For example, if X is any
topological space and Y is any subset of X, the set Y can be given its own
topology (called the 'subspace topology') defined by "a set U is open in the
subspace topology on Y if and only if U is the intersection of Y with an open
set from the original topology on X." This potentially introduces new open
sets: if V is open in the original topology on X, but $V\cap Y$ isn't, then
$V\cap Y$ is open in
the subspace topology on Y but not in the original topology on X.

Topological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are
defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean
space is also a topological space.
