An eliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ has a Weierstrass equation of
the form $$E: y^2=x^3+ax+b$$ with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, such that
its discriminant $$\delta := -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)=\not= 0$$

Every eliptic curve over $\mathbb{B}$ has an integral Weierstrass model (or equation):
$$y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6$$
$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6$ are integers.

Each such equation has a discriminant $\delta$.

A **minimal Weierstrass equation** is one of which $|\delta|$ is minimal
among all Weierstrass models for the same curve.

For elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, minimal models exist, and there
is a unique **reduced minimal model** which satisfies the additional
constraints $a_1,a_3\in{0,1}$, $a_2\in{-1,0,1}$.
If the minimal Weierstrass equation of $E$ is of the form of the
integral Weierstrass model, then $\delta$ is given by a polynomial
expression in $a_1,...,a_6$. Namely,
$$\delta=-b_2^2 b_8 -8b_4^3 -27b_6^2 +9b_2b_4b_6$$
where
$b_2=a_1^2 +4a_2$,  
$b_4= 2a_4 + a_1a_3$,  
$b_6= a_3^2 +4a_6$,  
$b_8= a_1^2a_6 +4a_2a_6 -a_1a_3a_4 +a_2a_3^2 -a_4^2$.

If the rank of an elliptic curve is 0, then the curve has only a finite number
of rational points. On the other hand, if the rank of the curve is greater than
0, then the curve has an infinite number of rational points.
Although Mordell's theorem shows that the rank of an elliptic curve is always
finite, it does not give an effective method for calculating the rank of every
curve. The rank of certain elliptic curves can be calculated using numerical
methods but (in the current state of knowledge) these cannot be generalised to
handle all curves.

An L-function L(E, s) can be defined for an elliptic curve E by constructing an
Euler product from the number of points on the curve modulo each prime p. This
L-function is analogous to the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-series
that is defined for a binary quadratic form. It is a special case of a
Hasseâ€“Weil L-function.

The natural definition of L(E, s) only converges for values of s in the complex
plane with Re(s) > 3/2. Helmut Hasse conjectured that L(E, s) could be extended
by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. This conjecture was first
proved by Deuring (1941) for elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It
was subsequently shown to be true for all elliptic curves over Q, as a
consequence of the modularity theorem.

Finding rational points on a general elliptic curve is a difficult problem.
Finding the points on an elliptic curve modulo a given prime p is conceptually
straightforward, as there are only a finite number of possibilities to check.
However, for large primes it is computationally intensive.
