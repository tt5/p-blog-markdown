$p_w$ complexity of a sequence $w$  
$\symcal{L}_n$ set of all length-n subwords appearing in $w$

$$
p_w = #\symcal{L}_n(w)
$$

Sturmian word: $p_w(n)=n+1$, $\forall n \ge 1$

$\mathrm{TM} Thue-Morse  
$$
p_{w_{\mathrm{TM}}}(2)= #{00,01,10,11}=4}
$$

Sturmian word:
One of the symbols is always isolated (corresponding to the smaller of the
components of the vector which defines our cutting sequence).  Sturmian
sequences are balanced (in fact this is a characterisation of Sturmian
sequences). A balanced sequence is one for which the abelianised difference of
any two length-n subwords of the sequence has entries at most of absolute value
1. For instance the abelianised difference of the word aababab and aabaaba is
(âˆ’1,1) because the first word has one more a, and the second word has one more
b.  Any aperiodic Sturmian sequence has irrational letter frequencies.
