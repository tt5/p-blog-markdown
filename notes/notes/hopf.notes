# Hopf algebra

Hopf algebras are convenient substitutes – essentially generalizations – of the
notion of a group

A **Hopf algebra** is an (associative and coassociative) bialgebra
over a field (or a commutative ring) together with a an antipode and
some axioms.

Any graded, connected bialbegra has an antipode.
