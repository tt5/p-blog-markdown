spiro

cubic BÃ©zier curves.

Fairness is ultimately a property of the way humans perceive curves, not an abstract
mathematical property.
Knowledge of the human visual system and empirical evidence show that fairness is intimately
tied to curvature, which of course is an objective mathematical property.

Bending energy has been proposed as a fairness metric, and minimizing that metric is the
definition of the MEC spline.

An extensional interpolating spline is one in which adding a new point to the control polygon,
lying on the curve generated from the original control polygon, does not change the resulting curve.
