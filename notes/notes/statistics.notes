$P(A)$ probability of $A$ event occurrence.
$P(AB)$ probability of both events occurrence.
It does not matter in which order the events occur.
$P(AB)=P(BA)$.
$P(A\mid B)$ probability of $A$ event occurrence,
provided that B event has already occured.
$P(AB)=P(A)P(A\mid A)$.
$$
P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A)P(B\mid A)}{P(B)}
$$
