$G$, finite group  
$K$, field

A $K$-representation of $G$ is a homomorphism $\chi: G \to \text{GL}(n,K)$.

$n$ is called the **degree** of $\chi$.

$K$-reprs $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ of $G$, both of degree $n$,
are **similar** if there exists an invertible $n\times n$ matrix $P$
over $K$ s.t. $\mathcal{Y}(g) = p^{-1}\mathcal{X}(g)P$, $∀g\in G$

$K[G]$, group algebra

If $\mathcal{X}$ is $K$-repr of $G$ with degree $n$,
then $\mathcal{X}$ can be extended linearly to $K[G]$.
The result is an algebra homomorphism $\mathcal{X}:K[G]\to M_n(K)$, where
$M_n(K)$ is the algebra of $n\times n$ matrices.

Assuming that $K$ is algebraically closed, the $K$-repr $\mathcal{X}$ of $G$
is irreducible iff $\mathcal{X}$ maps $K[G]$ to a full algebra $M_n(K)$.

$K=\mathbb{C}$  
$\mathbf{Z}$, centre

$$
\mathbb{C}[G]=\sum_{i=1}^{k} M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})
$$

$k=\text{dim}(\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{C}[G]))$ = number of classes of $G$.

$$
|G| = \text{dim}(\mathbb{C}[G]) = \sum_{i=1}^k (n_i)^2
$$

$G\to \mathbb{C}[G] \to$  
(projection to the $i$th summand)  
$M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is an irreducible $\mathbb{C}$-repr of $G$

write $\mathcal{X}_i$ to denote this repr

Every irred $\mathcal{C}$-repr of $G$ is similar to one of the $\mathcal{X}_i$

Given a $\mathbb{C}$-repr $\chi$ of $G$, the associated **character** $\chi$
is the function $G\to \mathbb{C}$ given by $\chi(g)=\text{trace}(\mathcal{X}(g))$.

We say $\mathcal{X}$ affords $\chi$.
Similar repr afford equal characters.

If $\mathcal{X}$ affords $\chi$ then $\chi(1)$ is the degree of
$\mathcal{X}$, it is called the **degree of** $\chi$.

$\chi(x^{-1}gx) = \chi(g)$, so characters are constant on conjugacy
classes.

If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are characters of $G$ afforded by $U$ and $V$ respectively,
then the representation $\mathcal{X}$ given by 
$$
\mathcal{X}(g) =
\begin{pmatrix}
U(g) & 0 \\
0    & V(g)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

affords the character $\chi = \alpha + \beta$

Sums of characters are characters. A character that is not a sum of two
characters is said to be **irreducible**.
Every character is a sum of irreducible characters.

Every character is a sum of irreducible characters.

character $C(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) = \{ \chi_j : 0 \leq j < n \}$

$\chi_j(m) = e^{\frac{2\pi imj}{n}} = e(\frac{mj}{n})$

$e(\alpha)a := e^{2\pi i\alpha}$

$\chi_0$ principal character = 1.

The **principal** character $1_G$ of $G$ is the trivial homomorphism,
with constant value $1$.

A character $\chi(\text{mod} q)$ is induced by $\chi_1(\text{mod} q_1)$, $q_1|q$
if $\chi(n)=\chi_1(n)$ for $(n,q)=1$.

A character $\chi$ is uniquely a sum of irred character.
These are called the irreducible constituents of $\chi$.

A character $\chi(\text{mod} q)$ is called **primitive** if it
is not induced by a character of a smaller modulus.

A **linear** character is a character $\gamma$ s.t. the degree $\gamma(1)=1$

The number of linear characters of $G$ is $|G : G'|$

$\text{Irr}(G)$ ist the set of irred characters of $G$.

Theorem:
The characters afforded by the $\chi_i$ are distinct and linearly idependent,
and they form the set $\mathrm{Irr}(G)$

$$
\sum_{\chi\in\text{Irr}(G)} {\underbrace{\chi(1)}_{\text{degree}}}^2 = |G|
$$

$|\text{Irr}(G)|=k$, the number of conjugacy classes of $G$.

$G$ is abelian iff every member of $\text{Irr}(G)$ has degree $1$. $G$
is abelian iff $k=|G|$.

The set $\text{Irr}(G)$ is a basis for the space $\text{cf}(G)$ of
class functions.

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a repr of $G$ with degree $d$ and let $g\in G$
have order $n$. Then $\mathcal{X}(g)^n=I$, the $d\times d$ identical
matrix.

The matrix $\mathcal{X}(g)$ is simila to a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are nth
roots of unity.

If $\mathcal{X}$ affords the char $\chi$, then $\chi(g) =
\text{trace}(\mathcal{X}(g)) = \epsilon_1 + \dots + \epsilon_d$, where
$\epsilon_i$ for $1\leq i \leq d$ are nth root of unity.

$\chi(g^{-1}) = \text{trace}(\mathcal{X}(g)^{-1} = \bar\epsilon_1 \dots
\bar\epsilon_d = \overline{\chi(g)}$

theorem:

Let $\chi$ be a char of a group $G$, where $\chi$ is afforded by a repr $\mathcal{X}$, and let $g \in G$. Then

(a) $|\chi(g)| \le \chi(1)$  
(b) $|\chi(g)| = \chi(1)$ iff $\mathcal{X}(g)$ is a scalar matrix  
(c) $\chi(g) = \chi(1)$ iff $\mathcal{X}(g)$ is the identity matrix

Let $\chi$ be a char of $G$. Then
$\{ g \in G | \chi(g) = \chi(1) \}$
is the kernel of every repr affording $\chi$.
In particular, this subset is a normal subgroup of $G$.

we write $\text{ker}(\chi) = \{ g \in G | \chi(g) = \chi(1) \}$
