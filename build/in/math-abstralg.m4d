# Intr

A **algebra** is a collection of sets, operators
on sets and rules.

An operation is **idempotent** that can be applied multiple times without changing
the result beyond the initial application.

$A,B$ Mengen.

A $n$-ary **relation** on a set $A$ is a subset of $A^n$.
**Relation** ($R$), $R$ Teilmenge von $A \times B$.

A relation $f : U → V$ from a set $U$ to a set $V$ is a subset of the cartesian
product $U × V$ .

The **domain** and the **range** of $f : U → V$ are the sets
$D(f ) = \{x ∈ U : (x, y) ∈ f, \text{for some} y ∈ V \}$ and $R(f ) = \{y ∈ V :
(x, y) ∈ f, \text{for some} x ∈ U \}$, respectively. If $f : U → V$ and $g : V → W$ are
relations, then the **composition** $g ◦ f : U → W$ is the set $\{(u, w) : (u, v) ∈
f \text{and} (v, w) ∈ g, \text{for some} v ∈ V \}$. The **converse** of a relation $f : U → V$ is
the relation $f^−1 : V → U$ given by $f^−1 = \{(v, u) : (u, v) ∈ f \}$.

The *equivalence class* of $a$ under $\sim$,
donated $[a]$, is defined as $[a]=\{b\in X|a\sim b\}$.

**Equality** (congruence) also adds:  
(substitutable) $a=b \Rightarrow f(a)=f(b)$

A **preorder** is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive.

If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two posets and $\alpha$
is a map from $P_1$ to $P_2$, then we say $\alpha$ is **order-preserving** if
$\alpha(a) \leqslant \alpha(b)$ holds in $P_2$ whenever $a \leqslant b$
holds in $P_1$.

**Poset**, partial order, $(X,\leqslant)$.  
Antisymmetrie, if $a\leqslant b$ and $b\leqslant a$ then $a=b$.

A category P is a partial order, or poset, if |P(a, b)∪P(b, a)| ≤
1, for all a, b ∈ P.

In order theory, a Hasse diagram is a type of
mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the
form of a drawing of its transitive reduction. Concretely, for a partially
ordered set $(S, ≤)$ one represents each element of $S$ as a vertex in the plane
and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from $x$ to $y$ whenever $y$
covers $x$ (that is, whenever $x < y$ and there is no $z$ such that $x < z < y$). These
curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their
endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its
partial order.

**Total order**, every pair of elements is comparable.

Indexing needs a total order.

#### Magma

A *set* and a binary operation  
Closed.

shorthand notation: xy = (x ⋅ y)

medial: $xy⋅uz=xu⋅yz$  
semimedial: left semimedial and right semimedial  
left semimedial: $xx⋅yz=xy⋅xz$  
right semimedial $yz⋅xx=yx⋅zx$  
autodistributive: left distributive and right distributive  
left distributive $x⋅ yz=xy⋅xz$  
right distributive $yz⋅x=yx⋅zx$  
unital if it has an identity element

A binary tree is a free Magma.

#### Quasigroup

Magma $(Q,\star )$, Latin square property (divisability)
For each $a,b\in Q$ there exists unique elements
$x,y\in Q$ such that
$$
a\star x=b\\
y\star a=b
$$
In other words: Each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and
exactly once in each column of the quasigroup's multiplication table, or Cayley
table. This property ensures that the Cayley table of a finite quasigroup is a
Latin square.
The unique solutions to these equations are written $x = a \ b$ and $y = b / a$.
The operations '\' and '/' are called, respectively, left and right division.

#### Loop
Quasigroup, identity.

A nonempty quasigroup is a loop
iff it satisfies the "slightly associative identity"
$x(y/y)\cdot z=x\cdot (y/y)z$

#### Semigroup}
Magma, associativity.

#### Monoid}
Semigroup, identity.

A monoid is a category M having precisely one object. In such a category, the
object, say ∗, is of no interest (at least from the point of view of category
theory). All of the structure of M resides in its set of arrows M(∗, ∗), which
is a set together with an associative binary operation and identity element for
this operation, that is, a monoid by the traditional definition.

We can make a group $X^\star $ simply by including only the elements from X that do
have inverses.

#### group}
Monoid, inverse elements.  
*or*  
Loop, associativity.

A group is a category having one object, in which every
arrow is an isomorphism.

#### abelian group}
Group, commutativity.
$(\mathbb{Z},+)$

# Group Theorie

$(G,\cdot)$ group.
$g,h\in G$.

$M\cdot N\coloneq\{m\cdot n : m\in M, n\in N\}$

$MN\coloneq M\cdot N$

$gN\coloneq\{g\}\cdot N$

$Ng\coloneq N\cdot\{g\}$

$G/N\coloneq\{gN:g\in G\}$,
**Faktorgruppe** (oder Quotientengruppe) von $G$ nach $N$.
"G mod N".
$G$ original group, $N$ normal subgroup.

Lagrange’s Theorem: if H is a subgroup of G, then the order of H evenly divides
the order of G.

Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. Then for each element $a \in G$ we can
define a left coset of H by

$aH = \{ ah \mid h \in H \}$.

That is, $aH$ is the set we get by combining a (on the left) with every element of $H$.

When the left and right cosets of a subgroup coincide, we say that the subgroup
is normal. (Hence every subgroup of a group with a commutative binary operation
is normal; but this can also happen even when the binary operation is not
commutative.  You can “divide” a group by one of its normal subgroups to get a
“quotient group”.  The coset aH has to have the same size as H: there is
exactly one element in aH for each element of H, and they all have to be
different.

Center:
$$Z(G) = \{z \in G \mid \forall g\in G, zg = gz \}$$

A group $G$ is abelian if and only if $Z(G) = G$.

The center of $G$ is always a normal subgroup of $G$.

#### trivial group}
$(\star ,\{e\})$

$e\star e=e$

#### simple group}
A nontrivial group whose only normal
subgroups are the trivial group and the
group itself.

A group that is not simple can be broken
into two smaller groups, a normal subgroup
and the quotient group, and the process
can be repeated. If the group is finite,
then eventually one arrives at uniquely
determined simple groups.

The **general linear group** (GLN) of degree n is the set of n×n invertible
matrices, together with the operation of ordinary matrix multiplication.

A linear map $L : V → W$ between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$:

$$\ker(L) = \lbrace \mathbf{v} \in V | L(\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{0} \rbrace$$

The **commutator** of two element, $g$ and $h$,
of a group $G$, is the element $[g,h]=g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$
(or in other definitions $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$).
It is equal to the group's identity if and only if $g$ and $h$ commute.

The expression $a^x$ denotes the conjugate of $a$ by $x$,
defined as $x^{-1}ax$.

$x^y=x[x,y]$  
$[y,x]=[x,y]^{-1}$  
$[x, zy]=[x,y]\cdot [x,z]^y$  
$[xz,y]=[x,y]^z\cdot [z,y]$  

Every group can be trivially made into a topological group by considering it
with the discrete topology; such groups are called **discrete groups**.

### Lie group

A **Lie group** is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the
property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure.
Any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra.  $R^n$ ist ebenso wie GL(n,R) eine
Lie-Gruppe, das heißt eine topologische Gruppe, bei der die topologische
Struktur die einer Mannigfaltigkeit ist.

Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with ordinary vector addition as the
group operation becomes an n-dimensional noncompact abelian
Lie group.

The unitary group $U(n)$ consisting of $n × n$ unitary matrices
(with complex entries) is a compact connected Lie group
of dimension $n^2$. Unitary matrices of determinant 1 form a
closed connected subgroup of dimension $n^{2 − 1}$ denoted
$SU(n)$, the special unitary group.

The group GL(n, R) is a Lie group of dimension $n^2$, called the
general linear group. It has a closed connected subgroup
SL(n, F), the special linear group, consisting of matrices
of determinant 1 which is also a Lie group.

A complex square matrix $U$ is unitary if $U^\star U=UU^\star =I$

### algebraic group

Loosely speaking, an algebraic group over a field $k$ is a group
defined by polynomials.

An algebraic group over $k$ is a group object in the category
of algebraic schemes over $k$.
In mathematics, a scheme is a mathematical structure that enlarges the notion
of algebraic variety.

For example, the group of matrices of determinant 1 is an algebraic group, as
is the orthogonal group of a symmetric bilinear form. The classification of
algebraic groups and the elucidation of their structure were among the great
achievements of twentieth century mathematics (Borel, Chevalley, Tits and
others, building on the work of the pioneers on Lie groups). Algebraic groups
are used in most branches of mathematics, and since the famous work of Hermann
Weyl in the 1920s they have also played a vital role in quantum mechanics and
other branches of physics (usually as Lie groups).

What we call an affine algebraic group is usually called an
affine group scheme of finite type.

Affine group schemes
are the Tannaka duals of certain tensor categories.

For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ , we define GL(V), resp.
SL(V), to be the group of
automorphisms of $V$, resp. automorphisms with determinant 1.

### Direct Product

Direct sum of abelian groups

Given groups $(G,\star )$ and $(H,\cdot)$, the direct product $G×H$ is defined as follows:

The elements of $G\oplus H$ are ordered pairs $(g, h)$, where
$g ∈ G$ and $h ∈ H$. That is, the set of
elements of $G × H$ is the Cartesian product of the sets $G$ and $H$.
The binary operation on $G × H$ is defined componentwise:

$$(g_1, h_1) ° (g_2, h_2)  =  (g_1 \star g_2, h_1 \cdot h_2)$$

The resulting algebraic object satisfies the axioms for a group. 

### Group Representation

Group representations can be used to represent
group elements as matrices, so that the group operation
can be representated by matrix multiplication.

A **representation** (rep.) of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$
over a field $K$ is a group homomorphism from $G$ to
GL($V$), $\rho:G$→GL($V$).

$\rho(gh)=\rho(g)\rho(h)$

$g.v=\rho(g)(v)$ makes $V$ a $G$-module.

$a\in G$, $G$ group. The representation of $a$ is $D(a)$.

$\displaystyle
\begin{pmatrix} D(a)_1\text{}_1 & \cdots & D(a)_1\text{}_n
²nn¹ \vdots & & \vdots
²nn¹ D(a)_n\text{}_1 & \cdots & D(a)_n\text{}_n
²nn¹ \end{pmatrix}
$

#### Character table}

complex number.
Rows indexed by $\text{Irr}(G)$.
Columns indexed by the set of classes of $G$.
Usually the first column corresponds to the class of
the identity in $G$ and the first row
corresponds to the principle character $1_G$.

**Character table**. Two-dimensional table whose rows
correspond to irreducible group representations,
and whose columns correspond to conjugacy classes
of group elements. The entries consist of *characters*.

$S_3$:

```txt
 1  1  1
 1 -1  1
 2  0 -1
```

$V$ finit-dimensional vector space over a field $F$.
The **character** of $\rho$ is the function $\chi_{\rho}: G→F$
given by $\chi_{\rho}(g)=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho(g))$, $g\in G$.

An **irreducible representation** (irrep.) $(\Pi, V)$ of an algebraic
structure $A$ is a nonzero representation that has no proper subrepresentation
$(\Pi,W), W \subset V$ closed under the action of $\Pi(a), a\in A$.

If group $G$ is finite then every rep. of $G$ is a
direct sum, $\oplus$, of irreps.

A linear subspace $W\subset V$ is called **G-invariant** if
$\rho(g)w\in W$ for all $g\in G$ and all $w\in W$.

The restriction of $\rho$ to a G-invariant subspace $W\subset V$ is known
as a **subrepresentation**.

A repr. $\rho : G \rightarrow \text{GL}(V)$ is said to be **irreducible** if
it has only trivial subrepresentations.

To say $X$ is irreducible means that it
is *not* similar to a representation $Y$ of the form

$$X(g)=
\begin{pmatrix}
  U(g) & 0\\
    \star & V(g)\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Note: Here, $U$ and $V$ are representations.

$G$ finite group  
$\rho: G \rightarrow \text{GL}(V)$  

There is a nondegenerate bilinear form on $V$
which is invariant under the action of $G$.

$<u,v> = <g.u,g.v>$, $g\in G$, $u,v \in V$

($g.u$ "$g$ acts on $u$", $\rho(g)u$)

You are able to choose matrices for $G$ of the form:

For example:

$\displaystyle
\rho(g)=
\begin{pmatrix} \star & | &   & 0
²nn¹ - & \star & \star & 
²nn¹   & \star & \star & -
²nn¹ 0 &   & | & \star
²nn¹ \end{pmatrix}
$

And the same block form for centralizer objects $\in Z_G(V)$:

$\displaystyle
\rho(g)=
\begin{pmatrix} a & | &   & 0
²nn¹    - & b & b & 
²nn¹      & b & b & -
²nn¹    0 &   & | & c
²nn¹\end{pmatrix}
$

if $Z_G(V)=\{ cI : c \not= 0 \}$
then $\rho$ is irreducible.

#### Young tableau

A Young tableau is called **standard** (STY) if the entries in each row and
each column are increasing.

A representation of the symmetric group on n elements, $Sn$
is also a representation of the symmetric group on $n − 1$
elements, Sn−1. However, an irreducible representation of
$Sn$ may not be irreducible for $Sn−1$. Instead, it may be a
direct sum of several representations that are irreducible
for $Sn−1$. These representations are then called the
factors of the restricted representation (see also induced
representation).

The question of determining this decomposition of
the restricted representation of a given irreducible
representation of $Sn$, corresponding to a partition λ of
n, is answered as follows. One forms the set of all Young
diagrams that can be obtained from the diagram of shape λ
by removing just one box (which must be at the end both of
its row and of its column); the restricted representation
then decomposes as a direct sum of the irreducible
representations of $Sn−1$ corresponding to those diagrams,
each occurring exactly once in the sum.

$\lambda \vdash n$

$$f^\lambda = |\text{STY}| \text{of shape}\lambda = \frac{n!}{\prod_{u\in \lambda} h(u)}$$

$h(u) = \lambda_i -1 +\lambda_j\text{'}-j+1$ **hook length** of the square $u=(i,j)$

### Symmetric Group

Symmetric groups are Coxeter groups and reflection groups. They can be realized
as a group of reflections with respect to hyperplanes

$S_n$, symmetrical group on $n$ letters.

$\sigma_i$ swappes the $i$th and the $i+1$th position.

*generators*: $\sigma_1, ...,\sigma_{n-1}$

*relations*:

-   $\sigma_i^2 = 1$
-   $\sigma_i \sigma_j = \sigma_j \sigma_i$ if $j\neq (i±1)$
-   $(\sigma_i \sigma_{i+1})^3 = 1$

## Ring

$(R,+,\cdot)$.
$(R,+)$, abelsche Gruppe.
$(R,\cdot)$, Monoid.
Multiplication distributes over addition,
$a(b+c)=ab+ac$, $(b+c)a=ba+ca$.

Ist $f\colon A\rightarrow B$ ein Ringhomomorphismus,
so ist die Menge $\ker(f)\coloneq  \lbrace a \in A | f(a) = 0 \rbrace$
der **Kern** von $f$. Er ist ein Ideal in $A$.

A **unit** is an element having a multiplicative
inverse. The set of units of a ring is a group
under ring multiplication.

A subring of $A$ is a subset that contains $1_A$ and is closed under addition,
multiplication, and the formation of negatives.

A ring is an integral domain if it is not the zero ring and if $ab = 0$ in the
ring implies that $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.

The **center** of a ring $R$ is the subset of $R$ consisting of all
those elements $x$ of $R$ such that $xr = rx$ for all $r$ in $R$. The
center is a commutative subring of $R$, and $R$ is an algebra
over its center.


## Ideal

Ring $R$.
**Ideal** $I$:
Subring of $R$ st.  
$IR\subseteq I$  
$RI\subseteq I$

Trinomial ideals are not special, binomial ideals are.
A Gröbner basis of a binomial ideal is binomial.
Binomial ideal is generated by binomials.

A non-empty subset $l$ of a partially ordered set $(P, \leqslant)$
is an **Ideal**, if the following conditions hold:
1. For every $x$ in $l$, $y<x$ => $y\in l$
2. For every $x,y$ in $l$, there is some element $z$ in $l$,
such that $x\leqslant z$ and $y\leqslant z$. ($l$ is a directed set)

Lattice:  
A subset $l$ of a lattice $(P,\leqslant)$ is an ideal if and only if
it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins (suprema),
i.e., it is nonempty and for all $x,y$ in $l$ the element
$x\vee$ of $P$ is also in $l$.
The dual notation of an ideal, the concept optained by reverting
all $\leqslant$ and exchanging $\vee$ with $\wedge$, is a **filter**.

$L/K$, $L$ field, $K$ subfield of $L$.
$L$ is an **extension field** of $K$.

If $L$ is an extension of $K$, then an element of $L$
which is a root of a nonzero polynomial over $K$ is
said to be **algebraic** over $K$. Elements that are
non algebraic are called **transcendental**.

The special case of $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q}$ is
especially important, and the names **algebraic number**
and **transcendental number** are used to describe
the complex numbers that are algebraic and
transcendental (respectively) over $\mathbb{Q}$.

An **ordered field** is a field $F$ together with
a total ordering $<$ that satisfies the following
properties. For every $x,y\in F$, if $x<y$ then
$x+z<y+z$; and if $x<y$ and $z>0$, then
$xz<yz$.

A ordered field with the least upper bound property
is **complete**.

$F$, ordered field, has the **least upper bound property**
if every non-empty subset of $F$ that has an *upper bound*
has a *least upper bound*.

Let $A$ be a set of real numbers. $s\in\mathbb{R}$,
$t\in\mathbb{R}$. $s$, **upper bound**:
$\forall a\in A \, a\leqslant s$.

$s$, **least upper bound** (supremum):
$\forall t<s\exists a\in A>t$.

There exists a complete ordered field.
There is only one **complete ordered field**,
in the sense that any two complete ordered fields
are isomorphic.

An algebraic closure of a field K is an algebraic extension of K that is
algebraically closed.

# Generating Set

Generating set of a group:
A set of group elements which are not contained in
any subgroup of the group other than the group itself.

A generating set of a group is a subset such that every element of the group
can be expressed as the combination (under the group operation) of finitely
many elements of the subset and their inverses.

When there is only a single element x in S, $〈S〉$ is usually written as $〈x〉$.
In this case, $〈x〉$ is the cyclic subgroup of the powers of x, a cyclic group,
and we say this group is generated by x. Equivalent to saying an element x
generates a group is saying that $〈x〉$ equals the entire group G. For finite
groups, it is also equivalent to saying that x has order |G|.

If S is finite, then a group G = $〈S〉$ is called finitely generated.
If a finite group is generated by a subset S, then each group element may be
expressed as a word from the alphabet S of length less than or equal to the
order of the group.
Every finite group is finitely generated since $〈G〉 = G$.

The most general group generated by a set S is the group freely generated by S.
Every group generated by S is isomorphic to a quotient of this group

Let S be a set and let $F_S$ be the free group on S. Let R be a set of words on S,
so R naturally gives a subset of $F_S$. To form a group with presentation <S | R>,
the idea is to take FS quotient by the smallest normal subgroup such that each
element of R gets identified with the identity. Note that R might not be a
subgroup, let alone a normal subgroup of $F_S$, so we cannot take a quotient by R.
The solution is to take the normal closure N of R in $F_S$. The group <S | R> is
then defined as the quotient group

$\langle S\mid R\rangle =F_{S}/N$.

The elements of S are called the generators of <S | R> and the elements of R
are called the relators. A group G is said to have the presentation <S | R> if
G is isomorphic to <S | R>.

It is a common practice to write relators in the form x = y where x and y are
words on S. What this means is that $y^{−1}x ∈ R$. This has the intuitive meaning
that the images of x and y are supposed to be equal in the quotient group. Thus
e.g. rn in the list of relators is equivalent with rn = 1. Another common
shorthand is to write [x, y] for a commutator $xyx^{−1}y^{−1}$.

the conjugate closure of a subset S of a group G is the subgroup of G generated
by $S^G$, i.e. the closure of $S^G$ under the group operation, where SG is the set of
the conjugates of the elements of S:

$S^G = {g^{−1}sg | g ∈ G and s ∈ S}$

The conjugate closure of S is denoted $<S^G>$ or $\langle S \rangle ^G$.

The conjugate closure of any subset S of a group G is always a normal subgroup
of G; in fact, it is the smallest (by inclusion) normal subgroup of G which
contains S. For this reason, the conjugate closure is also called the normal
closure of S or the normal subgroup generated by S.
Any normal subgroup is equal to its normal closure.

Generating set of a ring:
A subring $S$ of a ring $A$ **generates** $A$ if the only
subring of $A$ containing $S$ is $A$ itself.

A **minimal generating set** of a module over a ring $R$
is a generating set of the module such that no proper
subset of the set generates the module.

# Lattice

Two lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$ are isomorphic
iff there is a bijection $\alpha$ form $L_1$ to $L_2$
such that both $\alpha$ and $\alpha^{-1}$ are
order-preserving.

Two binary operations $∗$ and $\circ$, are said
to be connected by the absorption law if:
$a∗(a\circ b)=a\circ (a∗b)=a$.

A set equipped with two commutative, associative and
idempotent binary operations $\vee$ ("join") and $\wedge$
("meet") that are connected by the absorption law is called
a **lattice**. 

A lattice is a poset in which any two elements x
and y have a least upper bound (lub) (join, supremum), denoted by
$x\vee y$, and a greatest lower bound (glb) (meet, infimum), denoted by
$x\wedge y$.

A lattice $L$ is **distributive** if the following two equivalent
conditions hold $x\wedge (y\vee z) = (x\wedge y)\vee (x\wedge z)$
or equivalently $x\vee (y\wedge z) = (x\vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)$
$\forall x,y,z \in L$. The Boolean algebra $B_n$ is a distributive
lattice.

A **matroid lattice** is a lattice that is both atomistic and semimodular.
A **geometric lattice** is a finite matroid lattice.
Some authors consider only finite matroid lattices, and use the terms
"geometric lattice" and "matroid lattice" interchangeably for both.

A graded lattice is **semimodular** if, for every x  and y,
its rank function obeys the identity

$$
r(x)+r(y)\geq r(x\wedge y)+r(x\vee y).\,
$$

In a poset the atoms are the elements that cover some minimal element of the poset.

A lattice is said to be atomistic if every element is the lub of some set of atoms.

A poset is graded when it can be given a rank function $r ( x )$  mapping its
elements to integers, such that
$r(x)>r(y)$ whenever $x>y$, and
in particular $r(x)=r(y)+1$
whenever $x :> y$.

When a graded poset has a bottom element, one may assume, without loss of
generality, that its rank is zero. In this case, the atoms are the elements
with rank one.

The geometric lattices are cryptomorphic to (finite, simple) matroids, and the
matroid lattices are cryptomorphic to simple matroids without the assumption of
finiteness.
Two objects, especially systems of axioms or semantics for
them, are called cryptomorphic if they are equivalent but not obviously
equivalent.

Like geometric lattices, matroids are endowed with rank functions.
The maximal sets of a given rank are called flats. The intersection of two
flats is again a flat, defining a greatest lower bound operation on pairs of
flats; one can also define a least upper bound of a pair of flats to be the
(unique) maximal superset of their union that has the same rank as their union.
In this way, the flats of a matroid form a matroid lattice, or (if the matroid
is finite) a geometric lattice.

Conversely, if L is a matroid lattice, one may define a
rank function on sets of its atoms, by defining the rank of a set of atoms to
be the lattice rank of the greatest lower bound of the set. This rank function
is necessarily monotonic and submodular, so it defines a matroid. This matroid
is necessarily simple, meaning that every two-element set has rank two.

These two constructions, of a simple matroid from a lattice and of a lattice
from a matroid, are inverse to each other: starting from a geometric lattice or
a simple matroid, and performing both constructions one after the other, gives
a lattice or matroid that is isomorphic to the original one.

# Algebra (structure)

**Algebra structure**. Sets with finitary operations.

An **algebra** is a monoid in the category `Vect`.
A **coalgebra** is a monoid in the category `Vect`$_{op}$.

`type Algebra fa = fa -> a`

Given a Category.  
$F$ endofunctor. Used to form expressions.
$a$ object in the Category.  

Fa  
$a$ ist the carrier object

Fa -> a  
this morphism is the evaluation morphism (structure map). Evals expressions.

A monoid is the simplest algebra.

Commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ unique factorization
domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields 

The trivial absolute value is the absolute value with | x | = 0 when x = 0 and
| x | = 1 otherwise.[2] Every integral domain can carry at least the trivial
absolute value. The trivial value is the only possible absolute value on a
finite field because any element can be raised to some power to yield 1.

If | x + y | satisfies the stronger property | x + y | ≤ max(|x|, |y|), then
| x | is called an ultrametric or non-Archimedean absolute value, and otherwise
an Archimedean absolute value

any field, complete with respect to an Archimedean absolute value, is
(algebraically and topologically) isomorphic to either the real numbers or the
complex numbers.

A vector space with a linear product operation between elements of the space is
called an algebra.  An algebra over a field is a vector space (a module over a
field) equipped with a bilinear product.  In some areas of mathematics, such as
commutative algebra, it is common to consider the more general concept of an
algebra over a ring, where a commutative unital ring R replaces the field K.
The only part of the definition that changes is that A is assumed to be an
R-module (instead of a vector space over K).

A graded ring is a ring that is a direct sum of abelian groups $R_{i}$ such
that $R_{i}R_{j}\subset R_{i+j}$ . The index set is usually the set of
nonnegative integers or the set of integers, but can be any monoid. The direct
sum decomposition is usually referred to as gradation or grading.

A graded module is defined similarly (see below for the precise definition). It
generalizes graded vector spaces. A graded module that is also a graded ring is
called a **graded algebra**. A graded ring could also be viewed as a graded
Z-algebra.

A graded vector space is a vector space that has the extra structure of a
grading or a gradation, which is a decomposition of the vector space into a
direct sum of vector subspaces.

# Coxeter Group

Coxeter diagrams of finite groups correspond to point
groups generated by reflections.

A group with presentation

$$< r_1, r_2, ..., r_n | (r_i r_j)^{m_{ij}}=1 >$$

where  
$m_{ii}=1$  
$m_{ij}\ge 2$ for $i\not = j$  
$m_{ij}=\infty$ means no relation of the form $(r_i r_j)^m$
should be imposed.

#### Coxeter system}

$W$ group.
$S$ generators for $W$ of order 2.

TFAE:

-   $(W,S)$ is a **coxeter system**
-   $(W,S)$ satisfies exchange
-   $(W,S)$ satisfies deletion

exchange property:

if $w=s_1 ... s_k$ and $l(sw)<l(w)$, $s\in S$
then $sw=s_1 ... \hat s_i ... s_k$, (eliminate $\hat s_i$), for some $i$

deletion property:

if $w=s_1 ... s_k$ and $l(w)<k$
then $sw=s_1 ... \hat s_i ... \hat s_j ... s_k$, (eliminate $\hat s_i, \hat s_j$), for some $i,j$

If two reduced words represent the same element of a Coxeter group, then
Matsumoto's theorem states that the first word can be transformed into the
second by repeatedly transforming

xyxy... to yxyx... (or vice versa)

where

xyxy... = yxyx...

is one of the defining relations of the Coxeter group.

Matsumoto's theorem implies that there is a natural map (not a group
homomorphism) from a Coxeter group to the corresponding braid group, taking any
element of the Coxeter group represented by some reduced word in the generators
to the same word in the generators of the braid group.

# Braid group

$B_n$ braid group of $n$ strands.

The braid group is generated by $n-1$ elements $\tau_1, ..., \tau_{n-1}$ where
$\tau_i$ is the braid which crosses the $i$th string over the $(i+1)$st  string.

$B_n = < \tau_1, ..., \tau_{n-1} | \tau_i\tau_{i+1}\tau_i = \tau{i+1}\tau_i\tau_{i+1},
\tau_i\tau_j = \tau_j\tau_i for i+1 < j >$

With the additional relations \tau_i = \tau_i^{-1} the group reduces to the symmetric group.

An **Artin group** is a group with presentation of the form

$A = \langle s_1, \dots, s_n | s_i s_j s_i ... = s_j s_i s_j ... \text{for all } i \neq j \rangle$ where
$m_{ij} = m_{ji}$ is an integer $\ge 2$ or $m_ij = \infty$ in which case we omit the relation between $s_i$ and $s_j$.

$s_i s_j s_i ... = m_{ij}$
$s_j s_i s_j ... = m_{ji}$

With the additional relations $s_i = s_i^{-1}$ for all $i$, we optain a Coxeter group $W$.

$W = < s_i, ..., s_n | (s_i)^2 = 1, (s_is_j)^{m_ij} = 1 \text{for all} i \neq j > $

$S = \{ s_1, ..., s_n \}$

$(A,S)$ Artin system
$(W,S)$ Coxeter system

**rigth angled** Artin group (Coxeter group):
$m_{ij} \in \lbrace 2, \infty \rbrace \forall$ relations. $s_is_j = s_js_i$

The Artin braid group $B_n$ is the group generated by $n-1$ generators $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{n-1}$
and the "braid relations":

$\sigma_i\sigma_j = \sigma_j\sigma_i$ $\forall i,j = 1,\dots,n-1$ with $|i-j|\geq 2$

and

$\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i = \sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}$ $\forall i = 1,\dots,n-1$

$B_1$ is a trivial group

$B_2$ is an infinite cyclic group

$B_n$ with $n\geq 3$ is nonabelian

# Boolean Algebra

$$
p \Rightarrow q = p\text{'} \vee q$$
"if p, then q"
$$p \iff q = (p \Rightarrow q) \wedge (q \Rightarrow p)$$
the dual of $p-q$ is $q \Rightarrow p$, and
the dual of $p+q$ is $p \iff q$.
$$p|q = p\text{'} \wedge q\text{'}$$

## Complex numbers

#### root of unity

A root of unity is any complex number
that gives $1$ when raised to some integer power $n$.
$$z^n=1$$

$k$-th root of unity modulo $n$ for positive
integers $k$, $n\geqslant 2$, is a solution to the
congruence
$$x^k≡1$$
If $k$ is the smallest such exponent for $x$,
then $x$ is called a primitive $k$-th root of
unity modulo $n$.

## Quaternionen

The set of three-dimensional complex numbers is not closed under
multiplication.

Proof:

Assume that the usual rules of arithmetic for complex numbers hold, and that
$i^2 = j^2 = - 1$.  The proof is by contradiction, so we assume that a closed
multiplication exists. Since multi- plication is closed, there exist $a, b, c^2
\in R$ that satisfy $ij = a + i b + j c$ . Multiplying this with $i$ yields $-
j = - b + i a + ij c$. Substituting the first equation in the second equation
yields $- j = - b + i a + ( a + i b + j c ) c$, i. e. $0 = ( ac - b ) + i ( a +
bc ) + j ( c^2 + 1)$.  Thus $ac - b = 0$ , $a + bc = 0$ and $c^2 + 1 = 0$. The
equation $c^2 + 1 = 0$ gives the contradiction, since $c$ is real by
assumption.

$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = - 1$

$q = a + bi + cj + dk$

$a$ is the real or scalar part, and
$(b, c, d)$ is the imaginary or vector part.

$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$

The conjugate of quaternion $q$, denoted
by $q^\star $, is defined by
$(a + bi + cj + dk)^\star = a - bi - cj - dk$

$qq\star = q\star q = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$

A dual quaternion is expressed as:
$\hat{q} = q + q′ε$
We call $q$ the real part and $q′$ the dual
part.

$ε^2 =0$

$(q_1 + q′_1ε) (q_2 + q′_2ε) = q_1 q_2 + (q_1 q′_2 + q_1′ q_2)ε + 0$

The conjugate of a dual quaternion:
$q^∗  = (q + q′ ε)^∗ = q^∗ +q^{′∗}ε$

$(r_1,\ \vec{v}_1) (r_2,\ \vec{v}_2) = (r_1 r_2 - \vec{v}_1\cdot\vec{v}_2, r_1\vec{v}_2+r_2\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_1\times\vec{v}_2)$

$\lVert q \rVert = \sqrt{qq^\star }$

A unit quaternion is a quaternion of norm one. 

$q^{-1} = \frac{q^\star }{\lVert q\rVert^2}$

Using 2 × 2 complex matrices, the quaternion a + bi + cj + dk can be represented as

$$
\begin{bmatrix}a+bi & c+di \\ -c+di & a-bi \end{bmatrix}. 
$$

# Octonion

The octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of
real numbers. Every octonion is a real linear combination of
the unit octonions:

$\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\}$

# Lie algebra

**Lie algebra** is a vector space together with a
non-associative multiplication called Lie bracket $[x,y]$.

Any associative algebra $A$ over the field $K$ becomes a Lie algebra
over $K$ with the Lie bracket $[a,b]=ab-ba$.

A **Lie algebra** is a vector space $g$ over a field $F$ on which a
multiplication $g\times g \to g$, $x,y \to [xy]$ is defined satisfying the axioms:

(i) $[xy]$ is linear in $x$  and $y$  
(ii) $[xx] = 0$, $\forall x \in g$  
(iii) $[[xy]z]+[[yz]x]+[[zx]y]=0$, $\forall x,y,z \in g$

$[yx] = -[xy]$, $\forall x,y \in g$

Let $A$ be an associative algebra, i.e. a vector space with a bilinear
associative multiplication $xy$. Then we obtain a Lie $[A]$ by
redefining the multiplication on $A$. We define $[xy]=xy-yx$.

#

Number field

A number field $K$ is a finite degree algebraic extension of the rational
numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

# Exterior Algebra

The exterior algebra Λ(V) over a vector space V over a
field K is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor
algebra by the two-sided ideal I generated by all elements
of the form x ⊗ x for x ∈ V. Symbolically,

$\Lambda(V) := T(V)/I$

The exterior product ∧ of two elements of Λ(V) is defined by

$\alpha\wedge\beta = \alpha\otimes\beta \pmod I$

where the mod I means that we do the tensor product in the
usual way and then declare every element of the tensor that
is in the ideal to be zero.

# Tensor

A **Tensor** is a $n$-dimensional array of numbers.
($n=1$: vector; $n=2$: matrix).

Given any vector space $V$ over $F$, the **dual space**
$V^\star $ is defined as the set of all linear maps (linear Functionals)
$\varphi :V\to F$.
The dual space $V^\star $ itself becomes a vector space over $F$
when equipped with the following addition and scalar
multiplication:
$(\varphi +\psi)(x)=\varphi(x)+\psi(x)$,
$(a\varphi)(x)=a(\varphi(x))$,
for all $\varphi,\psi\in V^\star ,x\in V,a\in F$.

$V,W$ $\mathbb{K}$-vector spaces.
$F(V\times W)=\text{K-span}\{(v,w)|v\in V,w\in W\}$
free Vector space on $V\times W$.
Then $V\otimes W=F(V\times W)/I$
where $I$ is given by $$\{$$
$(a+b,c)=(a,c)+(b,c)$  
$(a,b+c)=(a,b)+(a,c)$  
$(\lambda a,b)=\lambda (a,b)$  
$(a,\lambda b)=\lambda (a,b)$  
$$\}$$

**Tensor**: a element of the tensor product.

type $(m,n)$ tensor.

$\star$

$\underbrace{V\otimes\dots\otimes V}_m$ $\otimes$ $\underbrace{V^\star \otimes \dots \otimes V^\star}_n$

In linear algebra, the term **outer product** typically
refers to the tensor product of two vectors. $a$, $b$ vectors,
$a\otimes b=ab^T$.

$A$, $B$, matices.
$$
\mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{B} =
\begin{pmatrix} A_{11}\mathbf{B} & A_{12}\mathbf{B} & \cdots & A_{1n}\mathbf{B}
²nn¹ A_{21}\mathbf{B} & A_{22}\mathbf{B} & \cdots & A_{2n}\mathbf{B}
²nn¹ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ A_{m1}\mathbf{B} & A_{m2}\mathbf{B} & \cdots & A_{mn}\mathbf{B}
²nn¹ \end{pmatrix} 
$$

If $V$ is a vector space, then
the **dual vector space** is
$V\star := \operatorname{Hom}_\mathbf{K}(V,\mathbf{K})=$
\{ linear functionals on $V$\}

$(V\star )\star =V$

If $C$ is a coalgebra then $C\star $ is an algebra.
If $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra then $A\star $ is
a coalgebra.

# quadratic characters

The congruence classes relatively prime to the modulus are a group under
multiplication, called the group of units of the ring Z/nZ, and the squares are
a subgroup of it. Different nonresidues may belong to different cosets, and
there is no simple rule that predicts which one their product will be in.
Modulo a prime, there is only the subgroup of squares and a single coset.

# Quantum group

Roughly a quantum group is a Hopf algebra whose modules or comodules form a
braided monoidal category.

$B$ bilinear form

A reflection with respect to $B$ is a linear map $r_u(v) = v - 2B(u,v)u$ for
some unit vector u.
